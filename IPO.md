Input: User is prompted to select an action from a menu: schedule an appointment, view scheduled appointments, or exit the program. 
If the user selects "schedule an appointment", they are prompted to enter the name, purpose, date, and time of the appointment.

Process: The program stores the inputted appointment details into a struct. The program adds the struct to an array of appointments.

Output: If the appointment is successfully added, the program outputs a success message. If the appointment cannot be added because
the array of appointments is full, the program outputs a message indicating this. If the user chooses to view appointments, the program 
outputs the name, purpose, date, and time of all appointments in the array.
