I.PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

The “Barangay Scheduling Appointment System” is a website or an app that could help in making appointments in the Barangay. 
In this program the user is prompted to select an action from a menu: schedule an appointment, view scheduled appointments, 
or exit the program. If the user selects "schedule an appointment", they are prompted to enter the name, purpose, date, and 
time of the appointment. With these, conducting and managing appointments would be easier and more organized.

II. IPO

Input: User is prompted to select an action from a menu: schedule an appointment, view scheduled appointments, or exit the program.
If the user selects "schedule an appointment", they are prompted to enter the name, purpose, date, and time of the appointment.

Process: The program stores the inputted appointment details into a struct. The program adds the struct to an array of appointments.

Output: If the appointment is successfully added, the program outputs a success message. If the appointment cannot be added because 
the array of appointments is full, the program outputs a message indicating this. If the user chooses to view appointments, the program
outputs the name, purpose, date, and time of all appointments in the array.
