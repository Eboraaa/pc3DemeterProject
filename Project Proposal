Barangay Appointment Management System

Project Description:

The “Barangay Appointment Management System” is a website or an app that could help in making appointments in the Barangay. 
In this program the user is prompted to select an action from a menu: schedule an appointment, view scheduled appointments, 
or exit the program. If the user selects "schedule an appointment", they are prompted to enter the name, purpose, date, and 
time of the appointment. With these, conducting and managing appointments would be easier and more organized.
